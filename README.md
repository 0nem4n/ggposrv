ggposrv.py
==========

Unofficial ggpo server (re)implementation

**Note**: This is just a proof of concept, not production ready yet.
 If you want to try it, easiest way is to edit your local `hosts` file to point the ggpo.net domain to the IP address of the machine where you run the custom ggposrv.py server (set it to 127.0.0.1 to run client and server on the same machine).

Video of it in action:
